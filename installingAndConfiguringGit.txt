search up: "Git - Downloading Package"

click on first result

click on "Click here to download" (see ex1.png)
(important part should have a red box around it)
this should download a file named "Git-2.46.0-64-bit.exe"

run file

choose preferred options, but mine are listed here:

Select Components - default
Default editor - VS Code
let git decide (most stable)
git from command line (to use with powershell, recommended)
bundled OpenSSH (important for connection with github)
openssl lib
checkout windows style
MinTTY
fast-forward or merge
git credential manager (convenient whenever you need a licence)
enable file system caching
no experimental stuff

click finish
should install correctly in C:\Users\USER_HERE\AppData\Local\Programs\Git

not done yet!
open windows powershell (use start menu search bar)
(also pin powershell to task bar since you'll be using it a lot from now on)

type in:
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

don't use your school email since the school blocks git hosting websites (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
i would recommend making a separate "developer" email account to separate your work life from personal life
but that's just me

ok, you got git set up!
next tutorial is in createFirstRepository.txt

if you've already went through createFirstRepository.txt and connectGitToGitHub.txt,
skip to workingWithGitHubRepository.txt
